        <h2>Chicken nugget recipe</h2>

        <p>
            The meat is ground, then forced under high pressure through screens that reduce the meat, bones, and other parts into a paste. 
            This paste is mixed with chicken skin and additives, including starch and sodium phosphate, and then shaped into nuggets.

            Mix buttermilk, tomato bouillon, sugar, garlic powder and paprika in a large container with lid. Cut up chicken into 1â€³ cubes and 
            place in buttermilk mixture. Allow chicken pieces to marinate in fridge overnight or for at least 4 hours
        </p>
